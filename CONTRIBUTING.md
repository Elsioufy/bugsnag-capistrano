  >
  > 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  > 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
  >    manner, and
  > 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  >
  > Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
  > extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

* Commit and push your changes
* Add a git tag with the new version of the library
* Update docs.bugsnag.com with any new content
